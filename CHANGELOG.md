# Changelog

## [v3.2.1](https://github.com/Cylix/cpp_redis/releases/tag/3.2.1)
### Changes
* Fix static initialization order fiasco condition
* Change `__CPP_REDIS_USE_TACOPIE` (cmake variable: `USE_TACOPIE`) into `__CPP_REDIS_USE_CUSTOM_TCP_CLIENT` (cmake variable: `USE_CUSTOM_TCP_CLIENT`). Of course, the meaning is now the opposite.

## [v3.2.0](https://github.com/Cylix/cpp_redis/releases/tag/3.2.0)
### Changes
* tacopie is no longer a mandatory dependency, but just provided by default and can be override if necessary.

### Additions
* add a new interface, `cpp_redis::network::tcp_client_iface` that allows you to use your own tcp_client in place of tacopie.

### Removals
* The `sync_client` has been removed as it was a duplicate of `redis_client::sync_commit` but with a different implementation based on futures. Please use `redis_client` and call `sync_commit` instead.

## [v3.1.2](https://github.com/Cylix/cpp_redis/releases/tag/3.1.2)
### Changes
* rename the `setbit()` function into `setbit_()` in order to avoid conflict with the standard library macro `setbit` causing compilation error.

### Additions
* add `send()` method to the `sync_client` and `future_client`.

### Removals

## [v3.1.1](https://github.com/Cylix/cpp_redis/releases/tag/3.1.1)
### Changes
* Fix: subscriber callbacks were sometimes not called due to poll not listening to the appropriate events. Mostly impacted windows as referred in #51, but unix version might also be impacted. Fixed by updating the reference tacopie which contains the fix.
